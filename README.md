## ðŸ›  Usage/Examples


### **Amortization schedule example**
- the 0 term represents the per payment timestamp, after this timestamp borrower can not run the pre payment 
- other terms represent the monthly payment, eg.

** Json file follows this formate 
Term Seq: ["Payment Date/Timestamp", "Payment Principal", "Interest", "Pre Interet", "All Pre Payment Principal" ]

```json
{   
    "0": ["1656719350", "0","16666666666666667", "2000000000000000000","10000000000000000000"],
    "1": ["1656719350", "0","16666666666666667", "2000000000000000000","10000000000000000000"],
    "2": ["1656719350", "0","16666666666666667", "1888888888888888883","10000000000000000000"],
    "3": ["1656719350", "0","16666666666666667", "1666666666666666663","10000000000000000000"],
    "4": ["1656719350", "10000000000000000000","1666666666666666667", "0","0"]

}

```

### create the root and Sign
```javascript
const { MerkleTree } = require('merkletreejs');
const keccak256 = require('keccak256');

/* hashing takes :
  -counter: the loan term eg 0,1,2,3,....
  -timestampPayment: array of the loan timestamp and the monthly payment
  the file contains :
  ["timestamp", "Principal", "Interest", "pre Interet", "Per Principal"]
*/

function hashloan(counter, timestampPayment) {
  return Buffer.from(ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256(['uint256','uint256','uint256','uint256','uint256','uint256'], [counter, timestampPayment[0],timestampPayment[1],timestampPayment[2],timestampPayment[3],timestampPayment[4]]).slice(2), 'hex')
}

```

-  Generate the root before Sig

```javascript
    const leaf = Object.entries(times).map(times => hashloan(...times));
    const merkleTree = new MerkleTree(leaf, keccak256,{sortPairs: true})
    const root = merkleTree.getHexRoot()
    console.log("root", root);

```
-  Create signture for starting a loan, this sig comes from the lender and 
it gets sent to the chain by the borrower.

```javascript
    const signature = await lender._signTypedData(
    // Domain
        {
            name: 'SwopXLending',
            version: '1.0',
            chainId: chainid,
            verifyingContract: swopXLanding.address
        },
        {
            Landing: [
                {name: 'nonce', type: 'uint256'}, 
                // nonce from the backend
                { name: 'paymentContract', type: 'address'}, 
                // erc20 address
                { name: 'offeredTime', type: 'uint256'}, 
                // offeredTime is a timestamp that should be in the future, otherwise this sig will be expired. 
                { name: 'loanAmount', type: 'uint256'}, 
                // Begining Balance
                { name: 'loanInterest', type: 'uint256'}, 
                // Total Interest
                { name: 'nftcontract', type: 'address'},
                { name: 'nftOwner', type: 'address'},
                { name: 'nftTokenId', type: 'uint256'},
                { name: 'gist', type: 'bytes32'}, 
                // root
            ], },
            {
                nonce:Number(0),
                paymentContract:u20.address,
                offeredTime: Number(1656459017),
                loanAmount:lendingAmount,
                loanInterest:interest,
                nftcontract:nft721.address,
                nftOwner:borrower.address,
                nftTokenId:Number(1),
                gist: root
            },);

```

- **cancel** function on the contract

Lender can cancel their sig and root at any time before the borrower start the loan. Once the loan starts, the lender can not cancel the deal.
```javascript
/*
* @notice: only lender can cancel their offer usin their nonces that they use to sign the loan deal
* @param nonce uint256 ID comes from the backend and it can be used  once   
* @param _lender address 
*/

await swopXLanding.connect(lender).cancel(nonce, _lender);

```

```javascript
/*
* @notice: this function only runs before the submit function and to calcalte the fees. It runs by the borrower.

* @param lendingAmount uint256 is total lending amount without the interest 
*/
let amountfee;
await swopXLanding.connect(borrower).calculatedFee(lendingAmount).then( res => {
    amountfee = res;
});


/*
* @notice: this function runs before 
    - make payment, make pre payment, and default functions
to get calculate interest fee before make a payment
* On the backend  there is two events needs to be ran
* @param termInterest uint256 is a the interest value from a json file 
*/

    feeInterest = res;
});

/*
    * @notice: make pre payment is an early repayment of all amount loan and interest loan by a borrower, NFT receipt can identify the addresses of the lender and borrower. 
    
    * verifiying tow proofs, the per Proof which needs to be beofre the per timestamp and proof which is the current term.

const makePerPayment = await swopXLanding.connect(borrower).makePrePayment(nftreceipt, term_,
    loanTimesPaymentInterest,preloanTimes,feePerinterest,firstproof,preProof);
await makePerPayment.wait();

```
